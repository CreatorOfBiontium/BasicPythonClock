More Info:
 I think that this just speaks for itself. The code isn't perfect, but I also think that it is not that bad (XD). 
 The best about this software is that it's just basic function, so you can do whatever you want with it
 (pls fix it for me :( I need it). 
 You can also add function like change date based on the timezone and more (functions in data/info.py).
 
 
Functions:
 There are function like change timezone (not fully developed), change background, toggle UMO, and more.
